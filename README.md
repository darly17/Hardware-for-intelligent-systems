# Laboratory Works on the discipline "Hardware for Intelligent Systems"

## Spring Quarter (Python)

### *Laboratory Lesson 1*
The code is written that:
- Converts a number from decimal format to binary in direct, additional and inverse codes
- Adds 2 numbers in additional code
- Implements the subtraction operation
- Multiplies 2 numbers in direct code
- Performs the division operation of 2 numbers in direct code
- Adds 2 positive floating-point numbers according to the IEEE-754-2008 standard (32 bits)

### *Laboratory Lesson 2*
A code has been written that:
- Accepts a logical function of arbitrary format containing logical operations &, |, !, ->, ~, and up to 5 variables (a, b, c, d, e)
- Based on the function, construct a truth table
- Based on the truth table, construct SDNF and SKNF
- Output the numeric form for SDNF and SKNF
- Output the index form of the function
  
### *Laboratory Lesson 3*
A code has been written that:
- Minimizes the SKNF by the calculation method
- Minimizes the SDNF by the calculation method
- Minimizes the SKNF by the calculation-table method with the output of the table
- Minimizes the SDNF by the calculation-table method
- Minimizes the SKNF by the tabular method (Karnaugh map) with the output of the table
- Minimizes the SDNF by the tabular method (Karnaugh map) with the output of the table
### *Laboratory Lesson 4*
A single-digit binary subtractor for 3 inputs with the representation of output functions in SDNF and
a program that performs the synthesis of a converter of tetrads of decimal-binary code D8421 into code 
D8421+n have been implemented
### *Laboratory Lesson 5*
Binary counter of subtractive type with 8 internal states in the basis of NAND OR and T-trigger.
### *Laboratory Lesson 6*
Implemented hash table data structure
Hash tables implement CRUD operations and support collision resolution
### *Laboratory Lesson 7*
a program has been implemented that works with diagonal addressing of a two-dimensional matrix
